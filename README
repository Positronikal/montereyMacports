montereyMacports

See the file VERSION in this directory for version information.

These shell utilities work on Macintosh macOS 12 Monterey to either
automate the installation of MacPorts or upgrade MacPorts if an
installation for an earlier version of macOS exists. Both utilities
must be ran from sudo and will create a ~/bin/MacPorts directory to
work from. In addition, they install a third utility in ~/bin to
automate MacPorts updating (macports_updater.sh). The updater also must
be ran from root. The install/upgrade utilities add ~/bin to your
path envar, so updater can simply be called from a terminal using:

$ sudo macports_updater.sh

Both the install/update utilities can be further improved by combining
them into a single script that determines at runtime if MacPorts is (1)
installed and already the current version, (2) is installed, but not
the current version, or (3) is not installed, then calling the
appropriate functionality from there. Contributors/testers may find
other areas of improvement.

If this is a beta release, you may find that the program is unfinished.
