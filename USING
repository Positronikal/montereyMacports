BASIC INSTALLATION

These shell utilities work on Macintosh macOS 12 Monterey to automate
some administration of the MacPorts package manager.

Unzip the montereyMacports download or navigate to the cloned
directory, depending on how you obtained the files from Github. Copy
either the install or upgrade script, since you only need one or the
other, to the directory on your Mac from which you intend to run it.
You will need to use sudo, so run either:

$ sudo macports_monterey_install.sh

...or if you already have a version of MacPorts for a previous macOS
version...

$ sudo macports_monterey_upgrade.sh

Once either completes, you'll have a ~/bin/MapPorts directory with an
update utility in the ~/bin directory. This directory will also be
added to your path envar and it can be called from the terminal using
sudo from that point.
